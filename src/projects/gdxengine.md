I was once fascinated with game engines and creating my own, yet I still wanted to learn higher level
implementation of core systems many use nowadays. In this project, I created a rendering queue and a modular
entity component system as a proof of concept for my idea. I decided to use Java since it is my most familiar
language and it was a very fun project to spin up.
