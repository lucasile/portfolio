This is a useful system information tool for Linux that can display user sessions, machine information, 
cpu usage, and memory usage. It was made for a course, although it taught me how the Linux filesystem works
in more depth, gave me more practice with C, and gave me important practice in writing documentation and
README files. Altogether, it was a really awesome and enlightening experience!
