I have always been very interested in multiplayer game networking and always enjoyed creating my own game servers and clients.
In this project I created a Java game server that could interact with Unity clients. While this was later remade in C# due to the
limitations Java had with Unity, I learned how TCP/UDP, sockets, and packets work. I was also able to create a modular and scalable packet system.
Click to see the client side Unity project, since the server has gone through many iterations.
