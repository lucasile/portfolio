title: Past Game Jams!

When I wasn't in university, I would try to learn how to create games on the Unity game engine with my friends.
We would enter multiple game jams and although our games felt a bit incomplete, we learned how to collaborate and organize
ourselves as a team, as well as the technical skills that came along with it.
